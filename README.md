# tRPC Demo

This tRPC demo uses Express, React, and Yarn in a monorepo.

## Quick start

Run the following in the root:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

The React client runs on localhost:3000.
The api-server runs on localhost:8080.

I generated some of the boilerplate via [npx create-mf-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mf-app).
